# Qantas Software Engineering Playbook


The purpose of the Software Engineering Playbook is to share the way of
the working amongst the various development teams across the Qantas
Group. Whilst our default view is to standardise amongst teams, we
embrace diversity in thinking and approach.

The Playbook should be thought of as a framework and not a standard.
Teams should default to the Playbook but select to opt out where you
believe the team can justify the need to be different.
