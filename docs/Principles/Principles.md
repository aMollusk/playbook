What does good look like? We benchmark our teams against the following
questions. These form our principles on what makes a high performing
team.

1.  Are you proud of every pull request?

2.  Do you have cross-functional teams that scope, build, test and
    > deploy together?

3.  Do you enforce documented coding standards?

4.  Do you have the best tools to maximise your productivity?

5.  Do you have automated test coverage for all key workflows?

6.  Do you automate continuous delivery and deployment?

7.  Do you support the code you build?

8.  Do you allocate time and resources to technical debt?

9.  Do you actively monitor and create alerts for your applications in
    > production?

10. Is security, customer privacy and safety your primary concern?

11. Do you invest time and resources in training?

12. Do you actively contribute to the software engineering culture and
    > evangelise our efforts?
