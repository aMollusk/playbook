Good Developers test this own work. Quality is the responsibility of the
Developer and self-testing should be across the end-to-end of the user
flow. The Developer and QA form a quality team that encompasses unit,
regression, acceptance, performance, security, stress, integration,
end-to-end testing are performed.
