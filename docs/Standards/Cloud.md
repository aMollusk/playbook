Instance Sizing:
----------------

1.  Select your cloud platform provider.

2.  Select a use case category that most closely describes your expected
    > workload. Some use cases correspond to particular SoftNAS Cloud
    > product recommendations.

3.  Review the resource properties for the chosen category to confirm
    > they match your expected level of instance resources.

> If unsure of your final selection, start with a larger instance size
> initially, deploy or simulate your production workload, then monitor
> and observe your results for 30 to 45 days.\
> \
> If your actual workload peaks are less than 50% CPU and network usage,
> then you may be able to reduce the instance size such that the peaks
> do not exceed 70%.\
> If CPU or network usage reaches 75% or higher, then an increase in
> instance size may be appropriate.
