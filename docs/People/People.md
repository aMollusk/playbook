Onboarding
----------

Effective onboarding allows our valuable new talent to embed themselves
in our business quickly and sets them up for success. Complete the
following checklist for all new starters:

-   Do Developers have access to all systems, accounts and equipment
    > before they start?

-   Have new starters been assigned a buddy?

-   Have new starters been introduced to key stakeholders and met with
    > their team?

-   Have new starters been taken through a product/domain walkthrough?

-   Do Developers have a fully functional dev environment before lunch?

-   Can Developers draw a high-level architecture by the end of the day?

-   Do Developers write and commit non-trivial code on day one?

-   Do new starters contribute to the onboarding process?

-   Do new starters feel more excited about Qantas and their role to
    > play by the end of the day?

It is expected our partners build an institutional knowledge about the
ways of work at Qantas and provided to new starters before they start.

Learning
--------

We use a T-shaped learning strategy at Qantas. We expect a broad
understanding across the technology landscape (horizontal). We also
expect Developers to specialise in one or a few technologies or
technical (verticals).

Developers are part of the greater Qantas community with many
opportunities to collaborate, learn and mentor with. Some of the
activities include:

-   TechHangar: Monthly forum to share knowledge about interesting
    > technologies, trends, projects, practices, etc available in per
    > person or Skype. Sessions are recorded and stored in the Qantas
    > wiki.

-   Hackathons: Performed quarterly. These are theme-based and we
    > encourage all staff to participate to innovate to build and test
    > new ideas focused on Qantas goals. Cross functional teams can be
    > formed to help understand the problem (including
    > Product/UX/Engineering/Support)

-   MeetUps: external and occasionally hosted on campus

-   Coding tournaments such as Secure Code Warrior

-   Partner conferences

Offboarding
-----------

We hate to see people leave, doing it well leaves a lasting impression.

-   Exit interviews: an exit interview should be given to all team
    > members. This is the opportunity for the person leaving to provide
    > feedback. We encourage one-way advice.

-   Handovers: ensure knowledge, access and contacts are handed over

-   Access removal: remove access to all systems, especially those not
    > covered under SSO.

All Software Engineers with access to Qantas systems must inform
Qantas on the Developers offboarding date prior to them leaving.

Evangelism
----------

Finally, we believe it is the role of every Software Engineer to be
proud of the work you do and even more so, proud of the team you work
with. We believe each individual should evangelise these great efforts
at MeetUps, conferences, guest blogs and BBQs.
