Versioning is standardised across all applications in the group. We
follow the guidelines as set out in Semantic Versioning 2.0.0
([https://semver.org](https://semver.org))

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

1.  MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,

2.  MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible
    > manner, and

3.  PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as
extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
