Design Principles
-----------------

Follow the [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)
principles, where possible:

-   Single Responsibility Principle

-   Open/Closed Principle

-   Liskov Substitution Principle

-   Interface Segregation Principle

-   Dependency Inversion

We also advocate the advice of [Clean
Code](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-code/9780136083238/)

1.  Bad code does too much -- Clean code is focused

2.  The language you wrote your code with should look like it was made
    > for the problem. It is not the language that makes a program look
    > simple, but the programmer who makes the language appear simple.

3.  It should not be redundant. Comply with DRY principles, although
    > don't become zealous on your implementation of this.

4.  Reading your code should be pleasant

5.  Can be easily extended by any other developer. Similarly, code
    > should easily be removed

6.  It should have minimal dependencies

7.  Smaller is better
