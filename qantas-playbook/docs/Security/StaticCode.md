Static Code Analysis
--------------------

All applications must use a Static Code Analysis(SCA) before going into
production. SCA should be initiative as part of the CI build cycle but
not required to synchronous that would make the build go red.

Veracode is the preferred solution, any other solutions must be approved
by the Cyber team.
