# Security

| REACH | ALL  | BY DIVISION | BY STACK |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | -------- |
| LEADS | BISO |             |          |

Key Rules:

- No PI Data in Source Code

- No credentials in Source Code

- Pen Test performed, shared and issues addressed for every major

  > release.

- Password complexity and rotation policy in place and mandated.

- Secure Code Training completed and certification required to approve

  > pull requests.

- All builds performed via CI

- No production access for any developer.

Use the following guidelines to help reduce you attack surface:

- **Validate input.** Validate input from all untrusted data sources.

  > Proper input validation can eliminate the vast majority of
  > software vulnerabilities. Be suspicious of most external data
  > sources, including command line arguments, network interfaces,
  > environmental variables, and user-controlled files

- **Heed compiler warnings.** Compile code using the highest warning

  > level available for your compiler and eliminate warnings by
  > modifying the code. Use static and dynamic analysis tools to
  > detect and eliminate additional security flaws.

- **Architect and design for security policies.** Create a software

  > architecture and design your software to implement and enforce
  > security policies. For example, if your system requires different
  > privileges at different times, consider dividing the system into
  > distinct intercommunicating subsystems, each with an appropriate
  > privilege set.

- **Keep it simple.** Keep the design as simple and small as possible.

  > Complex designs increase the likelihood that errors will be made
  > in their implementation, configuration, and use. Additionally, the
  > effort required to achieve an appropriate level of assurance
  > increases dramatically as security mechanisms become more complex.

- **Default deny.** Base access decisions on permission rather than

  > exclusion. This means that, by default, access is denied and the
  > protection scheme identifies conditions under which access is
  > permitted.

- **Adhere to the principle of least privilege.** Every process should

  > execute with the least set of privileges necessary to complete the
  > job. Any elevated permission should only be accessed for the least
  > amount of time required to complete the privileged task. This
  > approach reduces the opportunities an attacker has to execute
  > arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

- **Sanitize data sent to other systems.** Sanitize all data passed to

  > complex subsystems such as command shells, relational databases,
  > and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components. Attackers may be
  > able to invoke unused functionality in these components through
  > the use of SQL, command, or other injection attacks. This is not
  > necessarily an input validation problem because the complex
  > subsystem being invoked does not understand the context in which
  > the call is made. Because the calling process understands the
  > context, it is responsible for sanitizing the data before invoking
  > the subsystem.

- **Practice** **defense in depth.** Manage risk with multiple

  > defensive strategies, so that if one layer of defense turns out to
  > be inadequate, another layer of defense can prevent a security
  > flaw from becoming an exploitable vulnerability and/or limit the
  > consequences of a successful exploit.

- **Use effective quality assurance techniques.** Good quality

  > assurance techniques can be effective in identifying and
  > eliminating vulnerabilities. Fuzz testing, penetration testing,
  > and source code audits should all be incorporated as part of an
  > effective quality assurance program. Independent security reviews
  > can lead to more secure systems. External reviewers bring an
  > independent perspective; for example, in identifying and
  > correcting invalid assumptions.

- **Adopt a secure coding standard.** Develop and/or apply a secure
  > coding standard for your target development language and platform.
