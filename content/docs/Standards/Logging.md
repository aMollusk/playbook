Logs play an important role in development, allowing Developers and
DevOps to diagnose problems in an application before and after a
release; it allows Cyber to inspect and analyse behaviour and help build
metrics to ascertain platform health. A strong logging strategy should
be considered pivotal to the success of your application.

**Note: No PI data should every be stored in logs**

### Logging Traffic Lights

Aside from standard diagnosing application issues, logging hooks should
be written into your application from which to build monitoring and
alerting. Logging events should be based upon a traffic light principle.

- Red (fatal & error): fatal or unexpected values in the application.

  > Example: the application encounters an error which is preventing a
  > particular request from completing

- Amber (warn): exceptions or unusual behaviour that may forebode

  > future failure. Example: object detects inconsistency within an
  > external data feed and it performs a corrective action to
  > compensate for it.

- Green (info & trace): log key events in the system or user journey
  > to demonstrate application health. Example: registration, booking
  > and confirmation in a booking flow

### Logging Standard

We recommend you use the following logging standard in a key/value pair
that is easily searchable in Splunk.

- Timestamp: Date and time in UTC ISO8601 e.g. 20180915T155300

- Correlation id: e.g. session id

- Action: e.g. \"GET /libs/granite/csrf/token.json HTTP/1.1\"

- Status: in http error format e.g. 200

- Reason: human readable reason

- Level: e.g. INFO

- Message: The stack trace

#### Logging Levels

- **FATAL:** Events that indicate problems requiring immediate

  > attention. There may be different criticality of errors. The
  > assumption at this point is that the alarming built in to Splunk
  > will be configured to reflect.

- **ERROR:** Unhandled events that provide forewarning of potential

  > problems. This level should be used to log unhandled exceptions
  > which are caught by a catch block at the boundary of the
  > application which catches all occurring exceptions that have not
  > been handled by other exception handlers.

- **WARN:** Handled events that provide forewarning of potential

  > problems; although not a response to an actual error, a warning
  > indicates that a component or application is not in an ideal state
  > and that some further actions could result in a critical error.
  > This level should be used for handled exceptions. For example the
  > application requires a configuration setting but has a default in
  > case the setting is missing.

- **INFO:** All events which are required for audit purposes

- **DEBUG:** Events that perform \"normal operations\", e.g. mail

  > sent, user updated profile etc.

- **TRACE:** All other events:

  - Executed queries, user authentication, session expired messages

  - Begin method X, end method X etc.

  - Any event that could help with debugging

Note: To meet audit requirements the default setting should be level
INFO.
