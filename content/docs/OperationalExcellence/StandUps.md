# Stand-ups

Stand-ups or scrums are an invaluable form of communication, especially
in distributed environments. Key to successful stand-ups include:

- Actually standing

- Meetings should start promptly. If key stakeholders are missing,

  > start

- Ensure key themes are covered including what you need yesterday,

  > plans for today and any blockers identified

- Any discussion lasting more than a minute should be parked

- Ensure attendees are actively listening and not waiting their turn

  > to speak

- Discuss stand-up performance in your Retros
