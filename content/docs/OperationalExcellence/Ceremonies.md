# Ceremonies

All ceremonies (stand-up, chapter and guilds) are open meetings
available for all to attend. We believe that everyone's opinion is equal
and everyone gets to have their say. However, we do not need consensus
to move forward.

To maintain transparency, all chapter and guild agendas, the lead must:

- Post the agenda in an appropriate public Slack channel

- Document the meeting minutes in Confluence

- Post the meeting minutes link in the same Slack channel as the
  agenda
